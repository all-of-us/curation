-- exist in non-prod environments. This query runs daily and stores the result in

-- This script runs the following steps.
-- 1. Collect nonprod datasets info into a temp table.
-- 2. Loop for every `batch_size` datasets:
-- 2-1. Collect info about tables with person_id that are last updated within 3 days into a temp table.
-- 2-2. Check if any tables from 2-1 have violated person_ids. If yes, insert the info to id_violations_in_lower_envs.
-- 3. Check if any violation is found in this execution.
