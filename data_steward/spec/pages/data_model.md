# OMOP CDM

The OMOP Common Data Model (CDM) will be used to transfer EHR data to the Data Resource Core (DRC). The data model is an open-source, community standard for observational healthcare data. This document will cover the core tables that will be used to transport data to the DRC. The tables of interest for this export are: person, visit\_occurrence, condition\_occurrence, procedure\_occurrence, drug\_exposure, and measurement. All detailed information on the OMOP common data model can be found here: <http://www.ohdsi.org/web/wiki/doku.php?id=documentation:cdm#common_data_model>.

For the purposes of goal \#1 of this data sprint, the table definitions in this document are now the same as the OMOP specification in all fields for this submission. This document is based on the latest version of the OMOP CDM – version 5.1. The main change to the CDM with the latest version is the addition of the “datetime” columns to all the tables to capture time events. The columns with the name “source” refers to values from source systems. Every “source” field has two columns – source\_value and source\_concept\_id. For example, the LOINC code, 1963-8, for a bicarbonate lab would have “1963-8” for the source\_value column and “3016293” for source\_concept\_id. In cases where the HPO’s source system does not contain a standard terminology and only local codes are used, the source\_concept\_id would be “0” and the source\_value field would contain the local code and the description of the local code separated by a “:”
. For example, representing race for a local system would be “A:African American” in the race\_source\_value and the race\_concept\_id would be “0”.

For this data sprint, the OMOP vocabulary will be required. A version of the vocabulary for the All of Us Research Program can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1ctb6oEtLWLWFRqYXdWclZkbWM/view?usp=sharing). Once the file is unzipped, the CSV files that contain the vocabulary can be loaded into a database. The load script and table creation files can be found in the [CommonDataModel](https://github.com/OHDSI/CommonDataModel) repo on GitHub. Additionally, for this data sprint, the concept id columns are required to be populated. Examples of how to identify the “concept\_id” fields are in the below tables. It is also recommended to view the tutorials available online for both the CDM ETL (<http://www.ohdsi.org/common-data-model-and-extract-transform-and-load-tutorial/>) and the Vocabulary (<http://www.ohdsi.org/ohdsi-standardized-vocabulary-tutorial-recordings/)>. It is important to note that not all ICD codes map to a condition. It is important to look at the domain of the concept in the OMOP Vocabulary. For example, ICD-9 CM code “V72.19” (Other examination of ears and hearing) is considered a procedure and thus should be placed in the procedure\_occurrence table. Likewise, there are other ICD codes that should be placed in other tables.

## Notes
 * Conditions that are reported should be discharge diagnosis codes or problem list entries.
 * Not all ICD codes belong in the condition\_occurrence table. For example, ICD-9 CM code `V72.19` (Other examination of ears and hearing) is considered a procedure and thus should be placed in the procedure\_occurrence table.

The following were the diagnosis codes for each of the above visits:

|:--------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ED                 | Primary: Calculus of kidney (ICD9:592.0) <br> Secondary: Abdominal pain, right low quandrant (ICD9:789.03). Renal Colic (ICD9:788.0) |
| Both clinic visits | Calculus of ureter (ICD9:592.1)                                                        |
