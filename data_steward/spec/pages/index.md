title: Overview
template: page

An essential function of health care provider organizations (HPO) participating in the All of Us Program is to 
locate local electronic health record (EHR) data of participants who have provided consent and to share these data 
with the program following guidance provided by the Data & Research Center (DRC). This document serves as the source
of this guidance. It contains the technical specifications that data sets must adhere to in order for submitting HPOs 
to receive proper credit for their enrollment achievements. It describes the expected format, structure and content of 
EHR data submissions and the standard procedures governing these data sets (e.g. the procedures by which HPOs are 
expected to send data sets to the program).

This document is intended primarily for personnel (who we refer to as _data stewards_) who hold the responsibility 
of submitting EHR data on behalf of HPOs.

## Timeline

_Sites will be expected to upload datasets on a quarterly basis. Associated deadlines will be posted here._ 

## EHR Uploading
 - A sites is only authorized to upload EHR data after its ISA has been executed
 - Maintain accurate and updated site contact information with the DRC

## Data Sprint Goals
__For new sites to All Of Us the first step in submitting EHR data is to participate in a Data Sprint.__
1. Become Familiar with the OHDSI Vocabulary. Based on the previous data sprint, an abridged version of the OMOP vocabulary was created. This data sprint will assess sites capabilities in converting their coded data into OMOP concept IDs.
1. Examine Load Process of Data. The data sent will be transformed into a common data model to examine the data integrity of the EHR data sent. This will allow the DRC to better facilitate HPOs in transforming their data to the OMOP Common Data Model.
1. Review the Tutorial Instructions and Videos found in the [Sprint Documentation](https://joinallofus.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/WG/pages/324622/Data+Sprint?preview=/324622/469175/Tutorial%20Instructions%2012.7.16.docx)
