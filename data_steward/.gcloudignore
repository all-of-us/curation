# This file specifies files that are *not* uploaded to Google Cloud Platform
# using gcloud. It follows the same syntax as .gitignore, with the addition of
# "#!include" directives (which insert the entries of the given .gitignore-style
# file at that point).
#
# For more information, run:
#   $ gcloud topic gcloudignore
#
.gcloudignore
.git
.gitignore

# Duplicating .gitignore entries below because
# the gcloudignore include directive does not accept paths (i.e. "../.gitignore")
# and to reduce potential issues with *ignore inconsistencies
