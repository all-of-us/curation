"""In PPI surveys, the purpose of questionnaire_response_id is to group all responses from the same survey together.
Some PPI questions allowed participants to provide multiple answers, which be will connected via the same
questionnaire_response_id. However, a participant may submit the responses multiple times for the same questions,
therefore creating duplicates. We need to use the combination of person_id, observation_source_concept_id,
observation_source_value, and questionnaire_response_id to identify multiple sets of responses. We only want to keep
the most recent set of responses and remove previous sets of responses. When identifying the most recent responses,
we can't use questionnaire_response_id alone because a larger questionnaire_response_id doesn't mean it's created at
a later time therefore we need to create ranks (lowest rank = most recent responses) based on observation_date_time.
However, we also need to add questionnaire_response_id for assigning unique ranks to different sets of responses
because there are cases where the multiple sets of responses for the same question were submitted at exactly the same
timestamp but with different answers. In addition, we also need to check whether one of the duplicate responses is
PMI_Skip because there are cases where the most recent response is a skip and the legitimate response was submitted
earlier, we want to keep the actual response instead of PMI_Skip regardless of the timestamps of those responses."""
