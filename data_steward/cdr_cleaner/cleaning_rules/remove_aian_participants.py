DC-685 - removing participants who identified as AI/AN in PPI.

There is a requirement from the NIH that participants who identified as AI/AN in PPI cannot have ANY of their data
included in released datasets for the Data Browser or Workbench/Cohort Builder. These participants have had their data
retracted non-programmatically previously. However, since this is expected to be a long-term policy, this should be a
cleaning rule applied to combined so this can be automated.
We will remove ALL DATA in combined associated with PIDs who have rows with the following in the observation table:
observation_source_concept_id = 1586140
value_source_concept_id = 1586141
