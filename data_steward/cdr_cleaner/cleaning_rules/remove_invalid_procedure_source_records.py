"""
Background

Some values for procedure_source_concept_id in the procedure_occurrence table have been identified as CPT modifiers,
which are supposed to be in the modifier_concept_id field.

While the CPT modifiers could be moved to the correct field, this would leave these rows with
procedure_source_concept_id=0, which has little utility. Therefore, these rows should be dropped.

Cleaning rule to remove records where:
-procedure_concept_id is not a standard concept in the procedure domain
AND
-procedure_source_concept_id is not in the procedure domain (they ARE allowed to be non-standard).
