Background

Background: For physical measurements collected by the Program, warnings or limits exist for height, weight, and BMI;
however, there are still some outliers in the dataset from before the addition of these limits (or in cases where limits
are more relaxed). These outliers need to be dropped to improve data quality.

Scope: Create the following cleaning rule (all Weights are in KILOGRAMS all Heights are in CENTIMETERS): In the
measurements table, extreme values of height, weight, and BMI should be dropped along with related values for the
participant.

This is expected to drop a very small number of rows (less than 300 total) based on values in the current CDR.
