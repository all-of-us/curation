Background

It is possible for a participant to have multiple records of Physical Measurements. This typically occurs when earlier
entries are incorrect. Data quality would improve if these earlier entries were removed.

Scope: Develop a cleaning rule to remove all but the most recent of each Physical Measurement for all participants.
Relevant measurement_source_concept_ids are listed in query
