    """
    Function is used to determine if the 'failing metrics' for a particular
    site are 'new' (appeared in the most recent iteration) or if they
    are 'old' (existed in the last iteration). If the metric is deemed to
    be 'old', the first_reported metric for the 'newer' version is reset
    to the former first_reported metric.

    Parameters
    ----------
    failing_metrics (list): contains DataQualityMetric objects that are
        known to 'fail' with respect to the thresholds established.
        these are the metrics from the newer file.

    old_failing_metrics (list): contains DataQualityMetric objects
        that are known to 'fail' with respect to the thresholds
        established. these are the metrics from the older file.

    prev_dashboard (string): name of the 'old' dashboards that
        should reside in an Excel file in the current directory.
        these dashboards will be necessary to update the
        'first_reported' aspect of DataQualityMetric objects.

    new_hpo_ids (list): contains the IDs of the HPOs that are
        new to the latest 'analytics report' and therefore are
        not contained in the previous 'panels'.

    excel_file_name (str): the name of the most recent 'analytics'
        report. contains the 'date' that will be assigned to
        novel data quality issues.

    Returns
    -------
    failing_metrics (list): now contains the DataQuality objects
        but has the updated first_reported attribute.
