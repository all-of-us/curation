# ## Script is used to model different distributions of 'foreign key' discrepancies. These 'foreign key discrepancies' are defined as instances where the date affiliated with a particular row is inconsistent with its associated visit dates.
#
# #### The tables evaluated (with respect to visit) are as follows:
# - Procedure Occurrence
# - Observation
# - Measurement
# - Condition Occurrence
# - Drug Exposure

# ### NOTE: This notebook is limited in terms of utility until the following problem is addressed:
#
# Many of the sites are uploading their date information in their local timezone (e.g. 12-11-2019). They are also uploading their datetime information in their local timezone (e.g. 12-11-2019 22:00 EST). Bigquery, however, applies a rule to their datetime information to adjust for time zone differences (e.g. the 12-11-2019 22:00 EST would turn into 12-12-2019 03:00 UTC).
#
# The issue, however, arises when the datetime object is towards the end of the day and this conversion ‘pushes'  the date of the datetime into the following day UTC. Since the ‘date’ object is never adjusted, the ‘dates' of the date and datetime are not considered equal and thus removed by one of our cleaning rules.
#
# This complication, however, **only** affects date/datetime discrepancies by +/-1. If a date is more than 1 day different from its datetime date, there must be an error on the site's end.

# ### NOTE: Much of this notebook was repurposed in the visit_date_disparity data quality metric that was imploemented in the 'table_metrics' analyses
