# ## Strategy for getting all related lab concepts
#
# We are going to use a combination of LOINC Group and LOINC Hierarchy because both classification systems cover some concepts the other does not cover. In general, LOINC Hierarchy provides generalized concepts that cover more descendants except for **physical measurements**, in which case we want to use LOINC Group.
#
# <ul>
#     <li>LONIC Group: going up 1 level is sufficient for getting the generalized lab concept ids. </li>
#     <br>
#     <li>LOINC Hierarchy: going up by 2 levels improved the coverages greatly. However, we need to place the restriction (going up by 1 level only) on Leukocytes, Protein and Cholesterol because their granularities are too “coarse”. Leukocytes in the hierarchy subsume concepts such as Neutrophils, Basophils, which are separate labs on their own. The same issue with another lab Protein that subsumes Albumin, which is a separate lab on its own.</li>
#     <br>
#     <li>We are going to union the descendants of the generalized lab concepts using LOINC Group and LOINC Hierarchy in order to identify whether or not the HPO sites have submitted the required labs. If a site submits data on any one of the labs, we will flag it as yes otherwise flag it as no. </li>
# </ul>
