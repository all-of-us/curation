# ## This notebook is used to investigate the racial and gender demographics for the EHR data for the AoU program. This notebook will investigate these data completeness metrics based on both the aggregate and site levels.
#
# ### Potential use cases:
# - Understand if sites are uploading incomplete/incorrect datasets
#     - example (as of 02/26/2020): a site is reporting >97% 'Unknown' racial concepts. this site would be expected to be fairly homogenous
#     - this information could be provided to sites so they could better assess whether or not their EHR matches the demographics that they might encounter in HealthPro
#     - see if the data being provided by AoU recapitulates existing findings with respect to healthcare disparities (e.g. which groups are more likely to seek care)
