# # QC for Participant Validation
# - This notebook checks the data quality of the participant validation tables and the EHR snapshot tables.
# - Run this notebook after generating the EHR snapshot dataset and the validation dataset.

# # Latest identity match table for each EHR site
# - This query lists the latest partitions of the identity match tables for the EHR sites.
# - Look at the columns `partition_id` and `last_modified_time`, and make sure the latest partitions were created recently (ideally within a few days).
# - If any EHR sites' latest partitions are old, try running `create_update_drc_id_match_table.py` for those EHR sites. It will create the latest partitions.
